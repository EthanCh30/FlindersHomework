## Arrays and String Processing

### Aims and Objectives

This laboratory has been designed to help you to gain experience in storing, retrieving and manipulating data
stored in arrays.

### Background

During this practical you will develop an event logging program for **wombat detection**. An event recorder, as
represented by the class `Recorder`, has a _position_ (_x,y coordinates_), a _name_
and a _list_ of event times (represented as an _**array of Strings**_).

The starting point is a basic version of the class `Recorder` and a class containing a **main** method which creates
a `Recorder` object and invokes some of its methods.

![A wombat running](../specification/wombat.jpg "Wombat")

### Getting Started

This practical initially contains two files: `RecordEvents.java` which contains the **main** method, and `Recorder.java`
a java class.

Carefully read the program taking special note of the comments and ensure how it works.

```java
/**
 * RecordEvents creates a single recorder, records 2 events
 * and prints out the complete list of events
 */
public class RecordEvents {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Recorder r1 = new Recorder(100, 100, "Wombat Detection");
        r1.recordEvent("10:53");
        r1.recordEvent("10:59");
        r1.printEvents();
    }
}

/**
 * A Recorder object can store up to 5 events
 * The time of each event is stored as a string
 * The constructor receives the coordinates of the recorder
 * and the name of the event type as parameters
 */
public class Recorder {

    private int xPos, yPos;
    private String eventType;
    private String[] event = new String[5];

    private int xEvent = 0;  // keeps track of how many events have occurred

    Recorder(int xPos, int yPos, String eventType) {
        this.xPos = xPos;
        this.yPos = yPos;
        this.eventType = eventType;
    }

    public void recordEvent(String eventTime) {
        event[xEvent++] = eventTime;
    }

    public void printEvents() {
        System.out.println("Record of " + eventType
                + " events at [" + xPos + "," + yPos + "]");
        /*<< delete this line and add a for loop here >>*/

        // Task 1:
        // Add a for loop as indicated above to print out each event (see Task 1 spec)
        // Note that not all 5 elements of the array are necessarily used
        // The variable `xevent` is always one bigger than the index of the last
        // event recorded. For example, after two events have been recorded (as
        // in the main method above) the value of `xevent` will be 2 .
    }
}
```

### Task 1 - Checkpoint 32

Add a for loop (where indicated) to the method `printEvents` to print out each event (see last 2 lines of the example
below).  
Run the program. The output produced should be:  <br><br>
**<tt>Record of Wombat Detection events at [100,100]  
Event number 0 was recorded at 10:53  
Event number 1 was recorded at 10:59</tt>**

---

### Task 2 - Checkpoint 33

1. Modify the program from Task 1 so that
    1. the length of the array `event` is specified with a constant (a _private final int_) named `EVENT_MAX`  (You
       will need to create the constant assign the value 10 to it and then use it as the size specifier for the array).
    2. the method `recordEvent` checks that there is room remaining in the array event to store another event (**Hint**:
       compare `xevent` and `EVENT_MAX`). If there is not then the message:  <br><br>
       **<tt>Event log overflow - terminating</tt>**  <br><br>
       should be output and the program terminated with the following method call:
       ```java 
        throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException();
       ```
2. Modify the method main to be following:

```java
    public class RecordEvents {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Recorder r1 = new Recorder(100, 100, "Wombat Detection");
        r1.recordEvent("10:53");
        r1.recordEvent("10:59");
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            String s = ((int) (Math.random() * 15) + 10) + ":" + ((int) (Math.random() * 51) + 10);
            r1.recordEvent(s);
        }
        r1.printEvents();
    }
}
```

Run the program. The output produced should be:  
(the line numbers in the exception message could be different)  <br><br>
**<tt>Event log overflow - terminating</tt>**

```java
Exception in thread"main"java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        at Recorder.recordEvent(Recorder.java:31)
        at RecordEvents.main(RecordEvents.java:17)
```

---

### Task 3 - Checkpoint 34

Modify the class `Recorder` to allow both the _time_ (as it currently does) and a _datum_ (an _int_)
to be recorded. To do this, the event array will now store objects containing both a `String`
and an `int` rather than Strings.

1. Modify the program from Task 2 as follows:
    1. Add another class called `EventInformation` containing:
        - A private instance variable called `eventTime` (a String)
        - A private instance variable called `eventDatum` (an int). The purpose of the
          variable is to store additional information related to the event. For example, a
          wombatâ€™s identifying number.
        - A constructor which takes a string and an integer as parameters and assigns them
          to the respective instance variables.
        - Accessor (getter) methods for the two instance variables.
    2. Add the following code to the start of **main** in order to test the new class:
       ```java
            EventInformation e = new EventInformation("10:53",45);
            System.out.println("Event recorded at " + e.getEventTime() +
                                ", datum = " + e.getEventDatum());
        ```
       **Change the for loop so that `i < 4` not 10**  
       Run the program. The output produced should be similar to the below:  <br><br>
       **<tt>Event recorded at 10:53, datum = 45  
       Record of Wombat Detection events at [100,100]  
       Event number 0 was recorded at 10:53  
       Event number 1 was recorded at 10:59  
       Event number 2 was recorded at 11:31  
       Event number 3 was recorded at 22:42  
       Event number 4 was recorded at 22:11  
       Event number 5 was recorded at 11:27</tt>**

    3. Remove all the code in the **main** method except:
       ```java
        Recorder r1 = new Recorder(100, 100, "Wombat Detection");
        ```
    4. In the `Recorder` class, create an instance variable named `eventInfo` to be an array of `EventInformation` and
       use `EVENT_MAX` to set the size.
    5. _Overload_ the method `recordEvent` with a header:
        ```java
        public void recordEvent(String time, int datum) { ...
         /* body goes here */
        }
        ```
       The body of `recordEvent` should store the values of `time` and `datum` in an `EventInformation`
       object, a reference to which is stored in an element of `eventInfo`.
    6. Add a method `printInfoEvents` so that both the `time` and `datum` are printed (see
       example output below). This will be very similar to the `printEvent` method.   
       <br>
       Add 3 calls to the end of the **main** method so that an event datum of 20 is also passed as an actual
       parameter, and a further 3 calls to include an event datum of 10 and then a call to `printInfoEvents` (see
       below).
      ```java
      r1.recordEvent("10:53", 20);
      r1.recordEvent("10:59", 20);
      r1.recordEvent("11:05", 20);
      r1.recordEvent("12:59", 10);
      r1.recordEvent("13:59", 10);
      r1.recordEvent("14:06", 10);
      r1.printInfoEvents();
      ```  
   Run the program. The output produced should be:  <br><br>
   **<tt>Record of Wombat Detection events at [100,100]  
   Event number 0 was recorded at 10:53 with datum = 20  
   Event number 1 was recorded at 10:59 with datum = 20  
   Event number 2 was recorded at 11:05 with datum = 20  
   Event number 3 was recorded at 12:59 with datum = 10  
   Event number 4 was recorded at 13:59 with datum = 10  
   Event number 5 was recorded at 14:06 with datum = 10</tt>**

---

### Task 4 - Checkpoint 35

1. Modify the program from Task 3 so that it
    1. makes use of the **String.split(...)** method to split each time (e.g. "10:58"), into it
       component numbers ("10" and "58")  
       For example:
       ```java
            String[] result = "this is a test".split("\\s");
            for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++)
                System.out.println(result[i]);
        ```
       prints the following output:  
       **<tt>this  
       is  
       a  
       test</tt>**  <br><br>
       **Hint:** The code above splits on the space character - you will need to split on something else.  <br><br>
    2. checks that the time is in the correct format (1 or 2 digits followed by a colon, followed
       by 1 or 2 digits)
    3. checks that the hour (the first number) is in the range 0 to 23 and that the minute
       (the second number) is in the range 0 to 59.
    4. checks that the events occur in sequence. That is, the time of an event is always later
       than the previous one recorded.
2. Assuming the `main` method of the class `RecordEvents` has the following code added to the end,

    ```java
    r1.recordEvent("10:53:4", 20);
    r1.recordEvent("10:zz", 20);
    r1.recordEvent("11:005", 20);
    r1.recordEvent("56:59", 10);
    r1.recordEvent("14:59", 10);
    r1.recordEvent("12:06", 10);
    r1.printInfoEvents();
    ```

the following output should be produced by that code (all other code should function as before):  <br><br>
**<tt>Invalid time format: 10:53:4, ignoring event  
Invalid time format: 10:zz, ignoring event  
Invalid time format: 11:005, ignoring event  
Invalid hour in time: 56:59, ignoring event  
Event out of sequence: 12:06, ignoring event  
Record of Wombat Detection events at [100,100]  
Event number 0 was recorded at 10:53 with datum = 20  
Event number 1 was recorded at 10:59 with datum = 20  
Event number 2 was recorded at 11:05 with datum = 20  
Event number 3 was recorded at 12:59 with datum = 10  
Event number 4 was recorded at 13:59 with datum = 10  
Event number 5 was recorded at 14:06 with datum = 10  
Event number 6 was recorded at 14:59 with datum = 10</tt>**
